# David Tinianow - M2 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My main goal for Module 2 is to maintain the momentum I built during Module 1.  I established a consistent routine that allowed me to stay on top of my work and succeed, and I plan to continue this.  I would also like to continue my involvement with the Turing community.  I would like to be a more active posse member, as well as help Module 1 students adjust with their transition into Turing.  Finally, I hope to use Module 2 as an opportunity to explore other side interests.  I also plan to start doing Exercisms to keep my programming chops fresh.
